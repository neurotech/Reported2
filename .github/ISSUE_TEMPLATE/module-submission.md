A list of the phrases that `Reported! 2` will randomly pull from. For example:

```
To swear, or not to swear: that is the question, clearly %Pl chose to - Hamlet, Act III, Scene I,
```

There are three "codes" for substituting the player's name in a module item. Using the example of "Playername":

`%pl` - will return `playername`
`%Pl` - will return `Playername`
`%PL` - will return `PLAYERNAME`
